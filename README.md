## 💡 Background
In the era of digital transformation, fast and accurate access to information has become a fundamental necessity, including within religious institutions. **GMI Bahtera Bandung Timur** previously faced challenges in disseminating worship schedules, church bulletins, and activity documentation, relying heavily on conventional methods (oral announcements/printed paper), which were often ineffective in reaching the entire congregation.

This project serves as an **appropriate technological solution** to bridge this information gap through a responsive, user-friendly website platform designed to be inclusive for users of all age groups.
